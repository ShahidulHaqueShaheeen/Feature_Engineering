# Feature Engineering Project

This repository contains multiple notebooks and resources focused on **Feature Engineering**, aimed at enhancing the predictive power of models by constructing and transforming relevant features.

## Overview
- This project covers various techniques and methodologies for **Feature Construction** and **Feature Transformation**.
- Includes practical implementations of **Pipelines** to streamline feature engineering processes.
- Explores **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and improved model performance.
- Uses tools and frameworks such as **pandas, scikit-learn**, and **NumPy** to build, transform, and evaluate features effectively.
